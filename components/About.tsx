                Currently pursuing a degree in <span className="font-medium">Computer Science Engineering</span>,
                I developed a strong passion for <span className="font-medium">AI/ML</span> while actively exploring
                the world of development. I have hands-on experience with
                <span className="font-medium"> Python</span> for AI/ML and am currently learning <span className="font-medium">Java </span>
                to master DSA. In web development, Iâ€™m most comfortable with
                <span className="font-medium"> Next.js and the MERN stack</span>.
                <span className="italic"> My favorite part of programming</span> is solving complex problems and
                optimizing solutions. I am currently looking for an <span className="font-medium">internship </span>
                as a Full Stack Web Developer and also opportunities to deepen my knowledge in AI/ML.
            </p>

            <p>
                <span className="italic">When I'm not coding</span>, you'll probably find me immersed in
                <span className="font-medium"> gaming</span>. Whether it's exploring new virtual worlds or
                competing online, I enjoy the thrill and challenge of gaming just as much as coding.
